        parametersImg: "",
        overview: `
          Application Description
– The medium is heated following filling (in a purified bottle) together with the bottle in the so-called pasteurizer
– The medium is heated shortly before the filler
– Typical products include tea, 100% juices, drinks with a pH value higher than 4.5 (i.e. bacterially sensitive products). This is often followed by aseptic filling
– Filling is carried out in a clean room. Previously the complete filler was in a clean room, nowadays only the actual filling process is located in a clean room
 
Technology Requirement
– 2~5 servo axis per machine or 1 big motor drive with gearbox
– Synchronous operation and position control
– Power: 12000~40000 bottles/ hr
 
System Diagram
– HV100 / HV480 / HV610 / HSD2 / SV-E3 / HSD7
 
Customer Benefit
– Closed-loop servo control integrated in the drive
– Dynamic response for acceleration/ emergency stop
– Angular synchronous operation with external encoder
– Servo technology in high end machine(every filler has one servo motor)

Application Description
– PET bottles are manufactured by blow mold machines
– A injection-molded preform (extruded) and blow molded into the corresponding negative form
– The pre-forms are pre-inspected using high-resolution cameras, since flaws in the pre-form cause waste
– The face seals, side walls and base are checked
 
Technology Requirement
– 2~4 servo axis per machine or 1 big motor drive with gearbox
– Synchronous operation and position control for the mold
