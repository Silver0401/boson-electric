          Application Description
– The medium is heated following filling (in a purified bottle) together with the bottle in the so-called pasteurizer
– The medium is heated shortly before the filler
– Typical products include tea, 100% juices, drinks with a pH value higher than 4.5 (i.e. bacterially sensitive products). This is often followed by aseptic filling
– Filling is carried out in a clean room. Previously the complete filler was in a clean room, nowadays only the actual filling process is located in a clean room
 
Technology Requirement
– 2~5 servo axis per machine or 1 big motor drive with gearbox
– Synchronous operation and position control
– Power: 12000~40000 bottles/ hr
